This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Jackify - Coding Test

## Running the Project

### To start the react website use the command:

```
npm start

```

### To start the express server run the command

```
npm run start-server

```

### This server reloads with nodemon when there are changes

### There is only one API - 'authenticate' which takes the Spotifiy client id and secret from the .env file to return an access token using the Spotify API.
